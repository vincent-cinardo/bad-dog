# Bad Dog!

"Bad Dog!" is a game I made for NeuroTechR3 for an internship through the New Jersey Institute of Technology. It is made in Unity utilizes the Leap Motion Controller to control the so called, bad dog. The dog escapes from the vet and the goal is to avoid obstacles, gather pickups, and make it to the home at the end.

Bad Dog! is made for neurorehabilitation for those with stroke. It exercises radial/ulnar deviation to restore motor function. Patient data is gathered to assess their progress.

Due to an NDA I have with NeuroTechR3, the most I can show is a video. Here is the link: {To be added}
